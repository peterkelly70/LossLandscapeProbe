# Generated on 2025-06-17 06:24:56
#
# This table shows how model performance varies with different dataset percentages.
# For each percentage, multiple random subsets were used with various hyperparameter perturbations.
# - Dataset Size (%): Percentage of the full dataset used for training
# - Random Subsets: Number of different random subsets used at each percentage level
# - Hyperparameter Perturbations: Number of hyperparameter variations tested per subset
# - Meta-Model Time: Time spent on meta-model training and prediction
# - Training Time: Time spent on actual model training
# - Total Time: Combined time for the entire process
# - Test Accuracy: Final accuracy achieved on the test set
# - Efficiency: Accuracy per unit time (higher is better)
